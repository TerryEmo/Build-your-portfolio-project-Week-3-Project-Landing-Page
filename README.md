 Build your portfolio project (Week 3): Project Landing Page


 What is a Landing Page?

A landing page is a webpage that shows information about the project without requiring the visitor to signup, login, or even use the application.

A closer look at what makes a great landing page.

When you open an incognito browser and visit google.com. What do you see? The page has a few links in the header and footer section, but the majority of the page is empty except for the Google logo, a text input field, a microphone icon and two clickable buttons “Google Search” and “I’m Feeling Lucky”

This is not a landing page. This is an application that is looking for a search term as input.

Let have look at https://www.google.com/search/about/.

There is a splash banner with a tagline “Be in the know” with a logo.

When you are  scrolling down, there are three features that are briefly explained, and a gif to help visualize the feature they are referencing. After reading the page, the webpage visitor learns that the Google Search application is meant to provide information, including current events relevant to a user’s favorite topics or location and in-depth knowledge to be explored. This page does not have a text field to take in a search term!
